# Oltreai-core Library

The Oltreai-core SDK library is used to manage entities and executions in Oltreai from Python.
The Oltreai-core layer is the foundational layer of the Oltreai Data platform.
It contains the core entities and objects (Artifacts, Projects, Secrets, Functions, Workflows, Task and Runs) and the methods to manage them.

A more detailed description of the library can be found in the [official documentation](https://scc-oltreai.github.io/docs/) of Oltreai.
